DEVELOPMENT

Dice is primarily developed at https://notabug.org/cryptarch/dice

There is a mirror at https://github.com/rpgreview/dice where development can also take place if desired.

Both of those repositories have Issues pages available where you can raise bugs, ask questions, give feedback or make feature requests.

Discussion and pull requests covering the following are welcome:

* Bug fixes.
* Performance enhancements.
* Sensible extensions to the syntax. Sensible means, it should be useful to a recognised community of gamers, and it should have a clear formalisable meaning.
* Cleaner and more robust methods for parsing and extending the syntax.
* Establishing a `~/.dicerc` file for customising the prompt, configuring readline behaviour, etc.
* Updating or expanding documentation.

BUGS

Before raising a bug, please test whether the bug is still present in the latest commit on the master branch.
If the bug is present in the latest commit on the master branch, please provide the following information with your bug report:

1. Summarise the bug in general terms.
2. What did you expect to see before noticing the bug?
3. How, specifically, did your observations differ from your expectations? (Copy-paste output from terminal preferred; screenshots also acceptable.)
4. What steps could an independent person follow to reproduce the bug?
5. What versions of Dice's dependencies do you have present on your system?
6. What options, flags and compiler did you select when building Dice?

If you raise an issue about a bug, please consider preparing a pull request which will add a test for the bug in the ./tests/ directory.

PERSONAL CONDUCT

When participating in discussions about Dice or contributing to its development, please try to adhere to the GNU Kind Communication Guidelines:

A summary of those guidelines:

OTHER TYPES OF CONTRIBUTION

If you don't feel confident as a coder, you haven't spotted any bugs, and you think the documentation is perfect, you might not be sure how you can help.

First of all, keep pursuing your own excellence in the computational arts!
Everyone has to start somewhere, so have faith in your ability to master what at first seems difficult.
And then, even if you don't end up contributing to Dice directly, you might end up writing some other software that will be valued by free software enthusiasts.
Thanks in advance ;)
